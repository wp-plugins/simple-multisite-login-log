Track user logins across a Multisite, Network, or Single site install

== Description ==

Provides the ability to track user logins across a WordPress Multisite, Network, or Single site install.

* Single site admins will only see logins specific to their site
* Network administrators will see logins across the entire network. ( Note that here the network admin is for a network inside a multisite, such as with wp-multi-network )
* The Multisite administrator ( over all sites and networks within the network ( I know, confusing right? ) ) can see logins across all sites and networks

For more info on the confusing naming convention see Nacin's post http://nacin.com/2010/03/25/terminology-nightmare-blogs-sites-networks/
